				About the Legend
			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on <b> 23 July 1856 </b>
                in an Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, 
                the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district 
                of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency).
                His ancestral village was Chikhali.
                In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai 
                when he was sixteen, a few months before 
                his father's death. After marriage, 
                her name was changed to Satyabhamabai.  <br><br>
				☛ He obtained his Bachelor of Arts 
                in first class in Mathematics 
                from Deccan College of Pune in 1877. 
                He left his M.A. course of study midway 
                to join the L.L.B course instead, 
                and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree 
                from Government Law College.<br><br>
				☛ After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics 
                at a private school in Pune. 
                Later, due to ideological differences with the 
                colleagues in the new school, 
                he withdrew and became a journalist. 
                Tilak actively participated in public affairs. 
                He stated: "Religion and practical life are not different.
                 The real spirit is to make the country your 
                 family instead of working only for your own. 
                 The step beyond is to serve humanity 
                 and the next step is to serve God."<br><br>
				☛ Inspired by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, 
                he co-founded the New English school for secondary education 
                in 1880 with a few of his college friends, 
                including Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, 
                Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi 
                and Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. 
				<br><br> ☛ Their goal was to improve the quality 
                of education for India's youth. 
                The success of the school led them to set up 
                the Deccan Education Society in 1884 to create 
                a new system of education that taught young Indians 
                nationalist ideas through an emphasis on Indian culture.</strong>
				<br><br> ☛ The Society established the Fergusson College 
                in 1885 for post-secondary studies. 
                Tilak taught mathematics at Fergusson College. 
                In 1890, Tilak left the Deccan Education Society 
                for more openly political work.
                He began a mass movement towards independence 
                by an emphasis on a religious and cultural revival.
				<br><br> ☛ Tilak had a long political career agitating 
                for Indian autonomy from British colonial rule. 
                Before Gandhi, he was the most widely 
                known Indian political leader.
                 Unlike his fellow Maharashtrian contemporary, 
                 Gokhale, Tilak was considered a radical Nationalist 
                 but a Social conservative. 
                 He was imprisoned on a number of occasions 
                 that included a long stint at Mandalay. 
                 At one stage in his political life he was 
                 called "the father of Indian unrest" 
                 by British author Sir Valentine Chirol.
				<br><br> ☛ Tilak helped found the All India 
                Home Rule League in 1916–18, 
                with G. S. Khaparde and Annie Besant. 
                After years of trying to reunite 
                the moderate and radical factions, 
                he gave up and focused on the 
                Home Rule League, which sought self-rule. 
                Tilak travelled from village to village 
                for support from farmers and locals 
                to join the movement towards self-rule.
				<br><br> ☛ Tilak was impressed by the Russian Revolution, 
                and expressed his admiration for Vladimir Lenin.
                The league had 1400 members in April 1916, 
                and by 1917 membership had grown 
                to approximately 32,000. 
                Tilak started his Home Rule League in Maharashtra, 
                Central Provinces, and Karnataka and Berar region. 
                Besant's League was active in the rest of India.
				<br><br> ☛ Tilak started two weeklies, 
                Kesari ("The Lion") in Marathi and Mahratta 
                in English (sometimes referred as 'Maratha' 
                in Academic Study Books) 
                in 1880–1881 with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar as the first editor.
				<br><br> ☛ By this he was recognized as 'awakener of India', 
                as Kesari later became a daily and continues publication to this day.
				<br><br> ☛  In 1894, Tilak transformed the household worshipping 
                of Ganesha into a grand public event (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav). 
                The celebrations consisted of 
                several days of processions, music, and food. 
				<br><br> ☛ The Deccan Education Society that 
                Tilak founded with others in the 1880s still 
                runs Institutions in Pune like the Fergusson College
				<br><br> ☛ On<b> 1st August 1920 </b>, 
                Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, 
                a diligent freedom fighter and Indian National Congress member, 
                died from cardiac arrest in Bombay 
                (now Mumbai City) at Sardar Griha. 
                Tilak dreamt of independence even on his 
                deathbed and said, “Unless Swaraj is achieved, 
                India will not prosper.
